# Project Title: Tetris
![Tetris](./resources/images/Tetris%20Image.jpg)

This project involves working with multidimensional arrays in Java to create and rotate tetris shapes.

## Code
The code for this project is written in Java and uses a variety of methods to accomplish its tasks. These methods include:

+ `printArray():` A method that takes a 3-dimensional array as input and prints it to the console.
+ `rotateArray():` A method that takes a 3-dimensional array as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise.

The main method of the code creates a 3-dimensional array with 4 rows, 4 columns, and 4 blocks. It then populates the array with tetris shapes using the "o" character. The main method then calls the printArray() method to display the original tetris shapes. It then calls the rotateArray() method four times to rotate the tetris shapes and display them in their rotated positions.

## Installation and run
